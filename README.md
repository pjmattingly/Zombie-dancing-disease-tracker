# Zombie dancing disease tracker
 An audit log service for tracking medical information related to the widespread Zombie dancing disease.

# Problem

As the Zombie Dancing Diseases (codename "Thriller") spreads throughout the world, there is a need to track medical information related to the disease; Thus the impetus for this project. As you know a patient is infecetd with the disease by dancing with others infected with the disease; Thus spreading exponentially. Initially the patient may not show symptoms, but eventually progresses to compulsory dancing as per the 1983 music video Thriller as performed by Michael Jackson; See (1). As such it is important to track the: initial infection, progressive symptoms, treatments attempted, and spread of the disease as Thriller reaches its terminal stage. As the only known cure for the disease is the "dance off" treatment, it is also important to note if the patient was cured and what other dance was used to put the patient(s) into remission.
